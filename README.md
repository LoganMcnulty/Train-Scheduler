- This project was designed for fine tuning firebase knowledge. The user can enter a ferry to the ferry Scheduler, and using 
Moment JS, and firebase databases, the minutes until arrival, and next arrival time, are always returned to the user, no matter
if they close the browser. 

- The project is useful because there is data consistency, and dealing with time/dates is something that comes up frequently
when writing code. The creator has plans to use this layout and format to create a stock market watchlist, with additional price metrics
using the AlpaVantage API

- The users can get started with this project by simply filling out the ferry scheduler form, and clicking Submit. They also have the choice
to remove individual ferries, or clear the entire sheet. 

- Users can contact the creator,, at LoganGMcNulty@gmail.com
